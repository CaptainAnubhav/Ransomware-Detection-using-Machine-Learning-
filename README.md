# Ransomware-Detection-using-Machine-Learning-
Developed a machine learning pipeline for ransomware detection by analyzing dataset features using heatmaps and selecting relevant attributes for model training.
Ransomware is a type of malware that encrypts a victim's files, making them inaccessible until a ransom is paid to the attacker for the decryption key. The past decade has seen a rise in ransomware attacks, which have been very sophisticated and have affected businesses, government institutions, healthcare facilities, and individual users. Such attacks often result in substantial financial losses, reputational damage, and disruptions in critical services. Ransomware-as-a-Service, or RaaS, also made it even easier for less-skilled attackers to deploy ransomware, fueling attacks across sectors.

Here is a brief description of each column in this dataset, with a focus on how it might relate to ransomware or malware detection using machine learning:
1.	Filename: Many ransomware families use consistent naming conventions for encrypted files, such as adding a specific extension (e.g., .locked, .encrypted, .cry). Detecting these extensions can alert the system to potential ransomware activity.
2.	Md5 Hash: It provides unique file identifiers and can detect changes due to encryption. By  comparing the file hash with malicious hashes which are already present in databases we can quickly spot ransomware.
3.	Machine: Represents the machine type that the file is compatible with. Different types of malware or benign software may target specific architectures, so this might provide some insights into compatibility.
4.	Debug Size: Indicates the size of the debug information in the file. Malware often minimizes debug information to evade detection, so patterns in DebugSize might hint at malicious or benign intent.
5.	Debug RVA: Relative Virtual Address (RVA) of the debug information in the file. Malicious files may try to obfuscate or minimize debug information, making this potentially useful for detection.
6.	Major Image Version: Major version number of the image (file) format. This could indicate the file’s compatibility with certain operating systems or platforms. Malware targeting specific OS versions might show patterns in this feature.
7.	Major OS Version: Major version number of the OS required to run the file. This can reveal if certain OS versions are more prone to a particular type of malware attack.
8.	Export RVA: RVA of exported functions. Malware often manipulates exported functions to carry out harmful activities, so this may offer insights into whether a file is malicious.
9.	Export Size: The size of the export section. Malware may use specific techniques in the export section for various tasks, like connecting to remote servers or executing malicious code, which may help in its identification.
10.	IatVRA: RVA of the Import Address Table (IAT). The IAT is often manipulated by malware to redirect functions to malicious code, making it an important feature for ransomware detection.
11.	Major Linker Version: The major version of the linker used to create the executable. Certain malware might be linked with specific tools, making this useful for identifying potential patterns associated with ransomware.
12.	Minor Linker Version: The minor version of the linker. Similar to MajorLinkerVersion, this may indicate the version of the linker used and provide insights into the development tools associated with malicious files.
13.	Number Of Sections: Number of sections in the executable. Malware and benign files often have different numbers of sections; for example, malware might have fewer sections to keep the file size small and avoid detection.
14.	Size Of Stack Reserve: Indicates the amount of stack memory reserved. Malware may have unique stack requirements depending on the complexity and type of operations, making this feature potentially useful for classification.
15.	Dll Characteristics: Characteristics of the DLL file, which might indicate whether the file has special attributes. Malware DLLs might have different characteristics than benign ones, as malware often manipulates these attributes for obfuscation.
16.	Resource Size: The size of the resources in the file. Malware might include embedded resources like images or strings (often encrypted) that it uses, resulting in resource sizes that differ from benign files.
17.	Bitcoin Addresses: Indicates the presence of Bitcoin wallet addresses. Since ransomware often demands payment in Bitcoin, files containing Bitcoin addresses may be highly suspicious and likely indicate ransomware.
18.	Benign: Target variable indicating whether a file is benign (1) or malicious (0). This column is the primary outcome the machine learning model will predict.

The first task is to analyze the dataset and select the necessary feature vectors that will be used in training the dataset. So we create a correlation matrix of the same to see the dependency of one feature on the other. The ‘Filename’ and ‘md5Hash’ columns being non-numerical are irrelevant in the plotting of the heat map. So I have dropped them. After seeing the correlation matrix we drop off the unnnecessary columns and then use the rest of the columns for training using various ML models like SVM,ANN,LSTM,Random Forests. Finally I have compared the results of the output of the different models.
